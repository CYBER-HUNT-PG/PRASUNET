            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            	<p> Welcome, this is my work for the task provided by Prasunet Company in Web Development.</p> 
		<p>Different ways to do the same thing can be applied here. </p>
		<p>I have used HTML to create the base of the project, including this paragraph and any other text.</p>
                <p>CSS was used to add the style that I wanted to the HTML file.</p>
                <p>JavaScript was the final addition to make the navigation bar interactive by changing colors when the cursor is hovering over the text.</p>

            <h1>Services Provided</h1>
                <p>Although I am still learning, there is little doubt in my mind that there will be any problems with me using various programming languages.</p>
                <p>Services that I can provide include the use of C, C++, Python(Begginer Level) and recently added quite slow usage of Java and SQL.</p>
                <p>My other projects have been in the field of Java software development/engineer and in web development.</p>
